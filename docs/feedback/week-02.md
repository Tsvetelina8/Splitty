#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There is a dedicated chair and minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was available in time before the meeting. It did follow the template and had good points and structure. More detail could've been included at points (like specific discussion points as you also mentioned in the meeting), but overall it was very good and this is a good example for the future meetings.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: N/A

Feedback: N/A Does not apply for this week as last week we didn't expect the groups to have a dedicated minute taker or chair.


#### Chair performance


Mark: Good

Feedback: The chair made sure that all topics were covered and that the meeting was on time. He also made sure that everyone was involved in the discussion. However, the topics could've been discussed in more detail and the meeting could've been more structured overall (at points it felt a bit loose). He could've also made sure that the quieter members were involved in the discussion (there were attempts at this but they weren't sucessful).


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Sufficent

Feedback: The team was mostly involved in discussion and active. The atmosphere was inviting and most people were listened to. Unfortunately, there are members that still don't speak at all or very few. Note, that this does not count as presence (if you aren't actively contributing). At times certain discussions could have been discussed outside of the meeting (like the exact details of task distribution).


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: Although the team did discuss ideas within the meeting relating to the product, the progress from last week on the product wasn't immediately obvious (you should incorporate time for this in the meeting where each member can talk about their accomplished tasks). For this week, you could've presented some mockups or a plan for the database (like other teams have done).

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: Naturally, the team did not discuss the action list of last week. This was brushed over and as a reminder this is part of the meeting rubrics. Similarly, to the product demo you can incorporate a dedicated time for this. We understand that this is the "first formal" meeting, but it's important to keep track of the progress going forward.
