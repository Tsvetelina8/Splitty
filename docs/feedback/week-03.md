#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There is a dedicated chair and minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: This week the agenda was very detailed and well structured. It was clear what was going to be discussed and when. The agenda was also followed well. Keep up the good work!


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The note taker did a good job, it seems that all important info is there, in an understandable format. As a TIP I recommend using bullet points and sub points (list format) to make the text more readable. You can also use tables for the points of action to also assign the tasks and put deadlines for this parts, this way it is more clear what are normal notes and the points of actions.


#### Chair performance


Mark: Very Good

Feedback: This week the chair did a good job in keeping the meeting on track and on time. They did roughly stick to the agenda, however the meeting still went under time at points. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is something to keep in mind for the future. You only have a limited amount of time to discuss everything, so make sure you use it wisely. In your meeting it can be helpful to discuss or brainstorm on the next steps related to roadblocks encountered. Nonetheless, good job!


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: This week the team was very good in terms of attitude and relation. The team was engaged and respectful. However, one person did not speak at all, this is something to keep in mind for the future, and the team should make sure that everyone is involved in the discussion, specifically the chair should make sure that everyone is involved in the discussion.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: This week the team has made good progress as they made entities and a start screen. The application was functional to a certain degree with hardcoded data. However, the shippable product is not yet ready, but the team is on track to develop it.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: This week in contrast to last week, the team was well prepared and their divison was clear. They clearly explained what they had done and it was clear that they had worked on the project. They had a dedicated slot to discuss the upcoming deadlines, which was really good. Keep up the good work!
