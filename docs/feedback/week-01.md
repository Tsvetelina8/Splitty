# Get to know each other

## Formative Assessment

#### 1) Self-organization

Insufficient: Everyone was kind and respectful. Yet, the conversation was largely dominated by two or three members. I did not hear at all from one member. Try to keep the meeting a bit more formal, but I understand that it is the first meeting and everyone is getting to know each other.

#### 2) Suggested Topics

Good: The team was able to discuss the topics without intervention of the TA to get started. For the first meeting, moderation is not expected, but it would be good to see the team take charge in the future.
