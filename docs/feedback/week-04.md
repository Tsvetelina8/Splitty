#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a dedicated chair and minute taker. The meeting was well organized and the agenda was followed.


#### Agenda 


Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The agenda was well prepared and covered all the necessary points. The agenda was followed and the meeting was well organized. It should be noted that in addition to the structure, the team should consider adding the names of who will be responsible for each point in the agenda. This will help to keep track of the action points and who is responsible for them. It can help group members prepare for the meeting and be more engaged in the discussion.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: I really appreciated that you used the agenda as a template for the minutes. This made it very easy to follow the minutes and the meeting. The minutes were well written and covered all the necessary points. The minutes were also well structured and easy to follow. You also made sure to include who was responsible for what point in the minutes. Very good job!

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: The team was very engaged and had a good attitude. There was more discussion from the quiter members of the team. The team was very respectful and listened to each other. The team was also very well prepared and had a good attitude towards the meeting. At times the team could consider the tone/wording of their feedback to be more constructive.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good
  
Feedback: The team has a potentially shippable product. The team has a basic UI and controllers for the UI. The team has not yet implemented the database logic but has controllers for the database. The team is well on track to deliver a potentially shippable product. For the next week, the team should consider implementing the database logic and making sure the UI is fully functional. However, considering it is week 4, the team is well on track.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The team had a dedicated slot to discuss and reflect on their work contribution both for the last week and upcoming week. This dedicated slot was very useful to understand the work distribution and the progress of the team. It was also good to see that the team was able to reflect on their work and plan for the upcoming week! Very good job!
